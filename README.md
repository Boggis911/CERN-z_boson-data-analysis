# CERN-z_boson-data-analysis

The main objective of the algorithm is to manipulate the given dataset and find 
the distribution of the given energy values while obtaining the function that accurately approximates the distribution.
The following program uses the dataset that was obtained from experiments conducted in CERN.

The algorithm does the following functions:
filters outliers in the data, 
rearranges the data points in a correct order, 
finds the best fit function and its parameters of the given dataset, 
plots the filtered data and the best fit function, 
calculates chi squared, describes the goodness of the fit function and finds other parameters.
