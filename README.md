# CERN-z_boson-data-analysis

The main objectives of the algorithm are to interpret the given dataset, find 
the distribution of the given energy values and obtain the function that accurately approximates the distribution.
The algorithm was created to interpret the dataset that was obtained from experiments conducted in CERN.

The algorithm does the following functions:
filters outliers in the data, 
rearranges the data points in the correct order, 
finds the best fit function and its parameters, 
plots the filtered data and the best fit function, 
calculates chi squared, describes the goodness of the fit function and finds other parameters.
